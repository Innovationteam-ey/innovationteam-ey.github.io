    <h2>Kutty Raghul</h2>
    <p>The 6-month internship experience was truly amazing. More than just a team, you guys felt like friends and family to me. As my first internship in the corporate world, 
        I didn't know what to expect, but being a part of your team turned out to be an unexpected and enriching experience. I learned so much during this time, and what stood out the 
        most was how you all never treated me as a intern, but rather as a friend and a little brother. Your support and camaraderie made this team a dream team for every IT 
        professional in their career. I consider myself lucky to have joined this incredible team at such an early stage in my life. For the first time in my life, 
        I realized what it would have been like to have an elder sibling like you guys - someone who cared for me and guided me through every situation.,
         as you guys always stood by me in every situation. The days in Bangalore were filled with memorable moments, and although
         I would often crack counter jokes, you all took it in stride and accepted me as a friend. I can't thank you enough for being a part of my life. Thank you, team! eppadiku ungal kutty raghulüòâ</p>
